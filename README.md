# Emojipic ðŸ¦„

Emojipic is a simple web app that lets you generate PNG images from emojis with a custom background color.

With the 3.0 release, Emojipic introduces three modes:
- **Standard Mode**: Generate a PNG from a standard emoji.
- **AI Mode**: Create your own emoji from a text prompt (requires a valid OpenAI API key).
- **Paste Mode**: Paste any image into the preview area and adjust its proportions and background color.
